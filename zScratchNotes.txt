import BrowserRouter into index and wrap it around App



RETURN STARSHIP NAME AND MODEL AND A BACK TO HOME

ROUTER .JS
    will use useEffect and useState to work
    we'll make an Axios call to SWAPI with useEffect to get all Starships
    make a useState variable for Starships at top of Router
            set its state within the useEffect to All Starships
    Make a Switch that has two routes
                        exact path "/" for HomePage
                            also gets a prop of starships
                        path "/starships" 
                            renders StarshipPage component
                                utilizes props.location to render a single starships
                                render={(props) => 
                                    <StarshipPage location=props.location}
                                    />}

HOME.JS
    "/" route renders Home component (/src/pages/Home.js)
    Should have clickable links for every starship in the starship state
    Each link should have a location defined by the current state of the starships state

    {props.starships.map(starship => {
        let location = {
            pathname: '/starship',
            state: starship
        }
        return (
            <Link
                to={location}
                key={starship.name}
            >
                {starship.name}
            </Link>
        )
    })}
    
If there are no starships it should display that it's "Loading..."
    toss that big fucker in a ternary in the render and call it a day


STARSHIP.JS
    When a <Link> is clicked on the Home.js page, a <StarshipPage> component should be
        rendered, displaying the starship's
            name
            model
            <Link> Return to Starship List </Link> ----> back to Home.js







Router          this sets up the whole shebang... routes, axios call, state
|
|
|___Home        first page being rendered, where the user lands--- router isn't rendered so it's the landing page to display all starships
        |    
        |_____Starship Page               this is to show off each starship and get it lookin all stylish an shiiiiiiiiid
